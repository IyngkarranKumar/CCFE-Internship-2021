# CCFE Internship 2021 #
This repo contains code from the CCFE internship. Its primary function is to compile two databases from raw <a href="https://ccfe.ukaea.uk/research/joint-european-torus/" target="_blank">JET</a> data. Due to JET data regulations, only the compilation code is stored in this repository (no JET data).  
Please see the report for a thorough overview of the work done during the internship.

Note from 13/04/22 - Currently in the process of refactoring code in this repo and reorganising file structure.
