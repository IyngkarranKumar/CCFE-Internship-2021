# CCFE Internship 2021 #
This repo contains code from the CCFE internship. Its primary function is to compile two databases from raw <a href="https://ccfe.ukaea.uk/research/joint-european-torus/" target="_blank">JET</a> data. Due to JET data regulations, no JET data is stored in this repository - only the compilation code is contained.  
Please see the report for a thorough overview of the work done during the internship.
